Arrays:
    Arrays are datastructures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Indexes always start from
    zero.
Why should we us arrays?
     Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data
     easily with the help of loops. Whenever wy have more than 3 similar items
     that we can to store and process together we should always go with arrays.
Syntax;
     There are two ways of creating the arrays.
     Method1:
     DataType[] nameOfTheArray={element1,element2,element3}
     Method2:
     DataType[] nameOfTheArray= new DataType[Size];
Enhanced For Loop:
     Enhanced For Loop is used to iterate through datastructures which have muntiple
     items stored inside them.
Whe should we use Enhanced For Loop:
Syntax:
     fro(DataTypesOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure) {
     }

 Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
     1)Enhanced For Loop can't be used for updating the elements.
     2)Access the elements in the reverse order etc.

Break:
      Break Keyword is used in switch cases statements and with the loops to
      terminate the loops prematurely.
Why we should use break keyword:
      -using break keyword can help save a lot of processing time and our code
      can execute faster.
Continue:
       Continue Keyword is used to skip the code from the loop once we hit the
       skip keyword java ignores the rest of the code in the loop and jumps to
       the next iteration.
